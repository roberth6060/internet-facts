              The internet is a hub of unending information. It makes sense to
              save all information in one place and access it from any location
              as needed; as a result, it is growing in popularity as it lessens
              the need for physical data transport while providing more security
              and comfort.

              markup language, which is made up of symbols and codes.

              Over a TCP/IP network, Telnet is a protocol that enables
              connections to distant computers. To connect to a telnet server,
              you utilize a piece of software on your computer called a telnet
              client (i.e., the remote host). You can communicate with the
              remote host from your computer after your telnet client connects
              to the distant host and turns into a virtual terminal.

              protocol for all activities on the World Wide Web (www). The
              protocol defines how messages should be structured, how they
              should be sent, how web servers and browsers should respond or
              function in every situation, and what instructions should be
              delivered.

            <td>
              The Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) protocol encrypts
              data sent between a user's web browser and a website during
              transmission. HTTPS queries are encrypted with TLS (SSL), and the
              requests and responses are also digitally signed. Therefore, HTTPS
              is far more secure than HTTP.

              background image, text size, text positioning, and more by
              utilizing CSS.
