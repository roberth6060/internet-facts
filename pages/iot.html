        <h1>Internet of things (IoT)</h1>
        <p>
          The internet of things is term referring to a network of physical
          items that are implanted with sensors, software, and other
          technologies for the main purpose of communicating and exchanging data
          with other devices and systems through the internet. These gadgets
          include anything from common domestic items to high-tech industrial
          gear. The advancement of modern technology as made the internet of
          things more practical and widespread. The technology includes access
          to affordable and cost-efficient sensor technology, connectivity,
          cloud computing platforms, machine learning analysis, and artificial
          intelligence.<br />Though the technology existed for numerous years
          now, it was not readily available or a feasible option for most
          people, but the technology becoming cheaper in recent years making IoT
          a viable option for manufacturers. Likewise, the widespread of more
          sophisticated networks protocols and cloud technology have made data
          transfer faster and as byproduct sensory technology have become more
          efficient. The cloud technology has been beneficial to both the
          business and customer by allowing sufficient and scalable cloud
          platforms and alleviate the need for research and development that can
          be costly. For instance, a company can enter the IT market and be
          prosperous from a profitable aspect while providing affording because
          there is already established cloud platforms.<br />The market for IoT
          is a very lucrative it has a potential just in 2011 the market value
          of $44.0 billion. Therefore, in the current economy the market is
          quite lucrative. Not to mention, internet of things (IoT). People who
          use the internet of things can live and work more intelligently and
          have total control over their life. IoT is crucial to business in
          addition to providing smart home automation devices. With the help of
          IoT, organizations can see in real time how their systems actually
          function, gaining insights into anything from equipment performance to
          supply chain and logistics activities.
