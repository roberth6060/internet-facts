        <h2>Internet</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            Before the creation of the internet the numerous computer networks
            did not have a standardize method of communication. The networking
            that the internetâ€™s predecessor, ARPANET provided was quite limited
            and mainly used for academic and research purposes. Though U.S.
            Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) would eventually
            be decommissioned on February 28, 1990 with the introduction of
            TCP/IP leading to the creation of modern internet. The unique IP
            address given to every device provided the ability to find the
            location of any Internet-connected device worldwide. Also, as the
            foundation for the internet as it currently exists, the TCP/IP
            protocol is important because it establishes the rules and stand
            procedures for how information can be communicated over the
            internet.

            The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by the British scientist,
            Tim Berners-Lee while he was working at as independent contractor at
            European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN). The creation of the
            web derived from need for the various scientist to readily share
            information. The scientist needed an efficient way of sharing
            research information promptly between the scientists in the
            different universities and institutions around the world. Along with
            Robert Cailliau, Tim Berners-Lee work extensively to create the
            first web server and browser editor running on the NeXT computer
            (cousin of the Macintosh) by 1990. The computer server would stay
            powered on so other computer could gain access to the necessary
            information. During the early stages the functionality of the web
            was very limited but over years it would evolve and now the web
            serves as the primary method of getting information through the
            Internet. It is a paradigm for exchanging information that is
            constructed on top of the Internet. Only one of the Internet's many
            languages, the HTTP protocol, is used by the Web to convey data. The
            Web is used to distribute information through web services, which
            employ HTTP to let applications connect with one another and
            exchange business logic. The Web also makes use of browsers like
            Internet Explorer or Firefox to access Web pages, which are
            electronic texts connected by hyperlinks. Web documents can also
            include audio, video, pictures, and text.

            <p>
              The internet consists of large amount of network and networking
              infrastructures. It creates a worldwide network by connecting
              numerous computers, allowing any computer to communicate as long
              as both computers are linked to the internet. Information is sent
              over the Internet via many languages referred to as protocols.
